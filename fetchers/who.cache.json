We had a call last week, and I was so amazed by the energy and passion of Lady Gaga, and her incredible commitment to humanity. That\u2019s when I said I think what she has planned can happen to bring the world together, to raise awareness and mobilize resources to fight the pandemic. I thank her for incredible passion and leadership, and my friend Hugh Evans for joining the dots, and for his leadership. <br></p>\n<p>We all look forward to joining you for the \u201cOne World: Together at Home\u201d concert on the 18th of April.<br></p>\n<p>As the pandemic continues, we recognize that individuals and governments want to do everything they can to protect themselves and others \u2013 and so do we.<br></p>\n<p>We understand that some countries have recommended or are considering the use of both medical and non-medical masks in the general population to prevent the spread of COVID-19.<br></p>\n<p>First and foremost, medical masks must be prioritized for health workers on the front lines of the response.<br></p>\n<p>We know medical masks can help to protect health workers, but they\u2019re in short supply globally.<br></p>\n<p>We are concerned that the mass use of medical masks by the general population could exacerbate the shortage of these specialized masks for the people who need them most.<br></p>\n<p>In some places, these shortages are putting health workers in real danger.<br></p>\n<p>In health care facilities, WHO continues to recommend the use of medical masks, respirators and other personal protective equipment for health workers.<br></p>\n<p>In the community, we recommend the use of medical masks by people who are sick and those who are caring for a sick person at home.<br></p>\n<p>WHO has been evaluating the use of medical and non-medical masks for COVID-19 more widely.<br></p>\n<p>Today, WHO is issuing guidance and criteria to support countries in making that decision.<br></p>\n<p>For example, countries could consider using masks in communities where other measures such as cleaning hands and physical distancing are harder to achieve because of lack of water or cramped living conditions.<br></p>\n<p>If masks are worn, they must be used safely and properly. WHO has guidance on how to put on, take off and dispose of masks.<br></p>\n<p>What is clear is that there is limited research in this area.<br></p>\n<p>We encourage countries that are considering the use of masks for the general population to study their effectiveness so we can all learn.<br></p>\n<p>Most importantly, masks should only ever be used as part of a comprehensive package of interventions. <br></p>\n<p>There is no black or white answer, and no silver bullet. Masks alone cannot stop the pandemic. Countries must continue to find, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact.<br></p>\n<p>Mask or no mask, there are proven things all of us can do to protect ourselves and others \u2013 keep your distance, clean your hands, cough or sneeze into your elbow, and avoid touching your face.<br></p>\n<p>Less than 100 days since WHO was notified about the new coronavirus, research has accelerated at incredible speed. <br></p>\n<p>The viral genome was mapped in early January and shared globally, which enabled tests to be developed and vaccine research to start. <br></p>\n<p>More than 70 countries have joined WHO's Solidarity Trial to accelerate the search for an effective treatment. And about 20 institutions and companies are racing to develop a vaccine.<br></p>\n<p>WHO is committed to ensuring that as medicines and vaccines are developed, they are shared equitably with all countries and people.<br></p>\n<p>I want to thank the Medicines Patent Pool and UNITAID for the initiative they announced last Friday to include medicines and diagnostics for COVID-19 in their licensing pool.<br></p>\n<p>I also want to thank the President of Costa Rica, President Carlos Alvarado, and the Health Minister, Daniel Salas, for their proposal to create a pool of rights to tests, medicines and vaccines, with free access or licensing on reasonable and affordable terms for all countries. Muchas gracias, Mr President.<br></p>\n<p>I support this proposal, and we are working with Costa Rica to finalize the details.<br></p>\n<p>Poorer countries and fragile economies stand to face the biggest shock from this pandemic, and leaving anyone unprotected will only prolong the health crisis and harm economies more.\u00a0 <br></p>\n<p>I call on all countries, companies and research institutions to support open data, open science and open collaboration so that all people can enjoy the benefits of science and research.<br></p>\n<p>Finally, we are nearing the end of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. If there are no more cases, the government of DRC could declare the outbreak over as early as this Sunday.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re not there yet, and we remain on full response mode. We\u2019re continuing to investigate alerts and to test samples. <br></p>\n<p>This would not have been possible without the incredible health workers who have put themselves at risk for more than 18 months to stop this outbreak. <br></p>\n<p>Just as health workers are putting themselves in danger to save lives from COVID-19, health workers in DRC faced the double threat of fighting a deadly virus in one of the world\u2019s most dangerous and unstable regions \u2013 exposing themselves to Ebola and bullets. <br></p>\n<p>Tomorrow is WHO\u2019s birthday \u2013 a day we celebrate each year as World Health Day. <br></p>\n<p>This year, we\u2019re paying tribute to the incredible contribution of all health workers, especially nurses and midwives.<br></p>\n<p>Nurses and midwives are the backbone of every health system. They\u2019re there from the first moments of life to the last.<br></p>\n<p>Tomorrow we are publishing our first report on the state of the world\u2019s nursing, which highlights gaps and makes recommendations for all countries.<br></p>\n<p>One of the lessons I hope the world learns from COVID-19 is that we must invest in health workers \u2013 not only to protect lives, but also to protect livelihoods.<br></p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---6-april-2020", "date": "6 April 2020", "title": "WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 6 April 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p>Good morning, good afternoon and good evening.<br></p>\n<p>As Tarik said, we\u2019re delighted to be joined today by Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing-Director of the International Monetary Fund.

This is an area of cooperation between WHO, the IMF and the World Bank.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>But ultimately, the best way for countries to end restrictions and ease their economic effects is to attack the virus, with the aggressive and comprehensive package of measures that we have spoken about many times before: find, test, isolate and treat every case, and trace every contact.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>If countries rush to lift restrictions too quickly, the virus could resurge and the economic impact could be even more severe and prolonged.<br></p>\n<p>Financing the health response is therefore an essential investment not just in saving lives, but in the longer-term social and economic recovery.<br></p>\n<p>There are three main areas for countries to focus on.<br></p>\n<p>First, we call on all countries to ensure core public health measures are fully funded, including case-finding, testing, contact tracing, collecting data, and communication and information campaigns.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>Second, we also call on countries and partners to strengthen the foundations of health systems. That means health workers must be paid their salaries, and health facilities need a reliable supply of funding to purchase essential medical supplies.<br></p>\n<p>Third, we call on all countries to remove financial barriers to care.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>If people delay or forego care because they can\u2019t afford it, they not only harm themselves, they make the pandemic harder to control and put society at risk.<br></p>\n<p>Several countries are suspending user fees and providing free testing and care for COVID-19, regardless of a person\u2019s insurance, citizenship, or residence status.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>We encourage these measures. This is in an unprecedented crisis, which demands an unprecedented response.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>Suspending user fees should be supported with measures to compensate providers for the loss of revenues.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>Governments should also consider using cash transfers to the most vulnerable households to overcome barriers to access.\u00a0\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>This may be particularly important for refugees, internally displaced persons, migrants and the homeless.<br></p>\n<p>===<br></p>\n<p>The pandemic is also having an effect on the fight against other diseases, like polio.<br></p>\n<p>As you know, in recent years we have driven polio to the brink of eradication. This has been a massive global effort, started by Rotary, supported by many other partners, and led by thousands of health workers, vaccinating children in some very difficult and dangerous areas.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>Many of those health workers are now supporting the COVID-19 response.<br></p>\n<p>They are tracing contacts, finding cases and providing public health information to communities.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>To reduce the risk of increasing transmission of COVID-19, the polio oversight board has made the hard decision to suspend house-to-house vaccination campaigns, knowing that this may lead to an increase in polio cases.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>To reduce this risk, we will support countries to maintain essential immunization for all vaccine preventable diseases.<br></p>\n<p>WHO has published guidance for countries on how to maintain essential health services even while responding to this crisis.<br></p>\n<p>The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is working to ensure that once it is safe to do so, countries can be supported to rapidly restart polio vaccination campaigns.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>While all our energy may be focused on COVID-19 now, our commitment to eradicating polio is unshakeable.<br></p>\n<p>Sadly, there are reports from some countries of an increase in\u00a0domestic violence since the COVID-19 outbreak began.<br></p>\n<p>As people are asked to stay at home, the risk of intimate partner violence is likely to increase.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>Women in abusive relationships are more likely to be exposed to violence, as are their children, as family members spend more time in close contact, and families cope with additional stress and potential economic or job losses.<br></p>\n<p>Women may have less contact with family and friends who may provide support and protection from violence.<br></p>\n<p>We call on countries to include services for addressing domestic violence as an essential service that must continue during the COVID-19 response.<br></p>\n<p>If you are experiencing or at risk of domestic violence, speak to supportive family and friends, seek support from a hotline, or seek out local services for survivors.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>Make a plan to protect yourself and your children any way you can. This could include having a neighbour, friend, relative, or shelter identified to go to should you need to leave the house immediately.<br></p>\n<p>There is never any excuse for violence. We abhor all violence of all forms, at all times.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>Finally, the global response to COVID-19 would not be possible without the generosity of countries and partners.<br></p>\n<p>Two months ago, WHO issued its Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, with an initial ask of US$675 million to support the response.<br></p>\n<p>I\u2019m delighted to say that almost US$690 million has now been pledged or received. Of this amount, US$300 million has been given to support WHO\u2019s work, and the rest has been given on a bilateral basis, or to other organizations involved in the response.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to thank the State of Kuwait, which today is becoming one of the largest donors, with a total of US$60 million.<br></p>\n<p>WHO\u2019s Solidarity Response Fund has now raised more than US$127 million from more than 219,000 individuals and organizations. I\u2019d like to thank Tencent for its contribution of US$10 million.\u00a0<br></p>\n<p>I\u2019m also pleased to announce that I have invited Unicef to join the Solidarity Response Fund. Unicef has extensive experience both in fundraising and in implementing programmes, and our partnership will help us to work together closely to save lives. Thank you so much, my sister Henrietta, for accepting my invitation.<br></p>\n<p>We still have a long way to go in this fight. WHO is working every day with all countries and partners to save lives, and to mitigate the social and economic impact of the pandemic.<br></p>\n<p>The IMF is a key partner, and I\u2019d now like to hand the floor to my sister Kristalina to make a few remarks. Thank you so much for joining us Kristalina.<br></p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19--3-april-2020", "date": "3 April 2020", "title": "WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 3 April 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p>Good morning. </p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to begin by thanking Member States for last week\u2019s briefing. </p>\n<p>It was inspiring to hear from China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore about their experience and the lessons they have learned. </p>\n<p>We plan to do another similar briefing in a few weeks\u2019 time, when we will have even more experiences to share from Europe and elsewhere. </p>\n<p>As I said at yesterday\u2019s press conference, this is a new virus, and the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus \u2013 two firsts. </p>\n<p>We are learning as we go, reviewing the evidence and adapting our recommendations as necessary. </p>\n<p>In the next day or two, we will reach more than 1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, and 50,000 deaths.</p>\n<p>This virus, which was unknown to us three months ago, has exposed the weaknesses and inequities in our health systems and societies, our lack of preparedness, and the gaps in our supply chains and other essential systems. </p>\n<p>We have to prepare our health systems for large numbers of cases, even as we maintain essential health services. </p>\n<p>We know that when health systems are overwhelmed, mortality from vaccine-preventable and other treatable conditions will increase dramatically. </p>\n<p>Gaps in essential care can result in many more deaths than the coronavirus itself. </p>\n<p>WHO has recently published guidance on maintaining essential health services while responding to COVID-19. </p>\n<p>This is one of more than 40 pieces of detailed, evidence-based guidance to guide countries in the response. </p>\n<p>Every day, we are engaged in numerous discussions with our extensive networks of experts to refine our guidance to reflect the best science. </p>\n<p>Our press conferences are a good way for us to highlight key messages for the world at large, but they are no substitute for technical guidance. We urge all countries to read and implement this guidance. </p>\n<p>We also recognize the need to adapt our guidance for different settings, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable communities. </p>\n<p>For example, we recommend handwashing and physical distancing, but we recognize that we need innovative solutions for communities that lack clean water, or live in cramped conditions. </p>\n<p>WHO, UNICEF and the International Federation of the Red Cross is calling for countries to provide free public hand hygiene stations in areas without access to water and sanitizer. </p>\n<p>We are already seeing the economic and social effects of this pandemic in high-income countries. In poor communities, those effects could be even more severe and long-lasting. </p>\n<p>We are calling on governments to provide a social safety net, so that vulnerable people have food and other essentials during this crisis.</p>\n<p>WHO, the World Bank and the IMF have united in a call for debt relief for developing countries, to enable them to implement those measures.</p>\n<p>I am glad to report that our research and development efforts are moving quickly. </p>\n<p>The Solidarity trial, which is assessing potential treatments for COVID-19, has already brought in 74 countries, which have either joined the trial or are in the process of joining.\u00a0</p>\n<p>More than 200 patients have been randomly assigned to one of the study arms. </p>\n<p>Two months ago, we issued our first Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, with an initial ask of $675 million for the first three months of the response. </p>\n<p>As of yesterday, I\u2019m delighted to say that $677 million has been pledged or received. </p>\n<p>Of that amount, $300 million has been pledged or received for WHO\u2019s operations, and the remainder has been given to partners or bilaterally. </p>\n<p>I want to put on record my deep gratitude to all Member States and partners for their generosity and solidarity. </p>\n<p>But as you know, the pandemic is many times larger than it was in early February, and the global needs have also increased significantly. </p>\n<p>WHO and partners will require much more support over the coming weeks and months, and we count on the continued support from governments, the private sector and the global community. </p>\n<p>We are now finalizing the second SPRP, and we will be presenting more details shortly. </p>\n<p>WHO is committed to working with all Member States to support you with the best evidence, to save lives.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I thank you.</p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-mission-briefing-on-covid-19---2-april-2020", "date": "2 April 2020", "title": "WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the Mission briefing on COVID-19 - 2 April 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p>Good morning, good afternoon and good evening.<br></p>\n<p>As we enter the fourth month since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I am deeply concerned about the rapid escalation and global spread of infection.<br></p>\n<p>Over the past 5 weeks, we have witnessed a near exponential growth in the number of new cases, reaching almost every country, territory and area. <br></p>\n<p>The number of deaths has more than doubled in the past week. In the next few days we will reach 1 million confirmed cases, and 50 thousand deaths.<br></p>\n<p>While relatively lower numbers of confirmed cases have been reported from Africa, and from Central and South America, we realize that COVID-19 could have serious social, economic and political consequences for these regions.<br></p>\n<p>It is critical that we ensure these countries are well equipped to detect, test, isolate and treat cases, and identify contacts \u2013 I am encouraged to see that this is occurring in many countries, despite limited resources.<br></p>\n<p>Many countries are asking people to stay at home and shutting down population movement, which can help to limit transmission of the virus, but can have unintended consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people.<br></p>\n<p>I have called on governments to put in place social welfare measures to ensure vulnerable people have food and other life essentials during this crisis. <br></p>\n<p>In India, for example, Prime Minister Modi has announced a $24 billion package, including free food rations for 800 million disadvantaged people, cash transfers to 204 million poor women and free cooking gas for 80 million households for the next 3 months.<br></p>\n<p>Many developing countries will struggle to implement social welfare programs of this nature. For those countries, debt relief is essential to enable them to take care of their people and avoid economic collapse. <br></p>\n<p>This is a call from WHO, the World Bank and the IMF \u2013 debt relief for developing countries.<br></p>\n<p>===<br></p>\n<p>Three months ago, we knew almost nothing about this virus. <br></p>\n<p>Collectively, we have learned an enormous amount.<br></p>\n<p>And every day, we learn more.<br></p>\n<p>WHO is committed to serving all people everywhere with the best evidence to protect their health.<br></p>\n<p>WHO develops guidance based on the totality of evidence collected from around the world.<br></p>\n<p>Every day, our staff talk to thousands of experts around the world to collect and distil that evidence and experience.<br></p>\n<p>We constantly review and update our guidance as we learn more, and we are working to adapt it for specific contexts.<br></p>\n<p>For example, we recommend handwashing and physical distancing, but we also recognize this can be a practical challenge for those who lack access to clean water, or who live in cramped conditions.<br></p>\n<p>Together with Unicef and the International Federation of the Red Cross, we\u2019ve published new guidance for improving access to handwashing.<br></p>\n<p>The guidance recommends that countries set up handwashing stations at the entrance to public buildings, offices, bus stops and train stations.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re also working hard with researchers all over the world to generate the evidence about which medicines are most effective for treating COVID-19. <br></p> <p>There has been an extraordinary response to our call for countries to join the Solidarity trial, which is comparing four drugs and drug combinations.<br></p> <p>So far, 74 countries have either joined the trial or are in the process of joining. <br></p> <p>As of this morning, more than 200 patients had been randomly assigned to one of the study arms.<br></p> <p>Each new patient who joins the trial gets us one step closer to knowing which drugs work. <br></p> <p>We\u2019re also continuing to study the evidence about the use of masks. <br></p> <p>WHO\u2019s priority is that frontline health workers are able to access essential personal protective equipment, including medical masks and respirators.<br></p> <p>That\u2019s why we are continuing to work with governments and manufacturers to step up the production and distribution of personal protective equipment, including masks. <br></p> <p>There\u2019s an ongoing debate about the use of masks at the community level. <br></p> <p>WHO recommends the use of medical masks for people who are sick and those caring for them. <br></p> <p>However, in these circumstances, masks are only effective when combined with other protective measures.<br></p> <p>WHO continues to gather all available evidence and continues to evaluate the potential use of masks more broadly to control COVID-19 transmission at the community level. <br></p> <p>This is still a very new virus, and we are learning all the time.<br></p> <p>As the pandemic evolves, so does the evidence, and so does our advice.<br></p> <p>But what doesn\u2019t change is WHO\u2019s commitment to protecting the health of all people, based on the best science, without fear or favour.<br></p> <p>I thank you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---1-april-2020", "date": "1 April 2020", "title": "WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 1 April 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p>Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, wherever you are.<br></p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is straining health systems in many countries.<br></p>\n<p>The rapidly increasing demand on health facilities and health workers threatens to leave some health systems overstretched and unable to operate effectively.<br></p>\n<p>Previous outbreaks have demonstrated that when health systems are overwhelmed, deaths due to vaccine-preventable and treatable conditions increase dramatically.<br></p>\n<p>Even though we're in the midst of a crisis, essential health services must continue. Babies are still being born, vaccines must still be delivered, and people still need life-saving treatment for a range of other diseases. <br></p>\n<p>WHO has published <a href=\"/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/maintaining-essential-health-services-and-systems\">guidelines to help countries</a> balance the demands of responding directly to COVID-19, while maintaining essential health services. <br></p>\n<p>This includes a set of targeted, immediate actions to reorganize and maintain access to high-quality essential health services, including routine vaccination; care during pregnancy and childbirth; treatment for infectious and noncommunicable diseases and mental health conditions; blood services, and more.<br></p>\n<p>That includes ensuring an adequate health workforce to deal with the many health needs other than COVID-19. <br></p>\n<p>For example, we\u2019re pleased by the 20 000 health workers in the UK who have offered to return to work, and that other countries such as the Russian Federation are involving medical students and trainees in the response. <br></p>\n<p>To help countries manage the surge in COVID-19 cases while maintaining essential services, WHO has also published a detailed, practical manual on <a href=\"/publications-detail/severe-acute-respiratory-infections-treatment-centre\">how to set up and manage treatment centres for COVID-19</a>.<br></p>\n<p>The manual covers three major interventions:<br></p>\n<p>First, how to set up screening and triage at health facilities, using a repurposed building or a tent.<br></p>\n<p>Second, how to set up community facilities to care for mild patients; <br></p>\n<p>And third, how to set up a treatment centre, by repurposing hospital wards or entire hospitals, or by setting up a new hospital in a tent.<br></p>\n<p>The manual covers structural design, infection prevention and control measures, and ventilation systems.<br></p>\n<p>This is a life-saving instruction manual to deal with the surge of cases that some countries are facing right now.<br></p>\n<p>These facilities will also have longer-term benefits for health systems once the current crisis is over.<br></p>\n<p>In addition to having facilities for patients, it\u2019s also vital that countries have sufficient supplies of diagnostics, protective equipment and other medical supplies.<br></p>\n<p>Ensuring free movement of essential health products is vital for saving lives and curbing the social and economic impacts of the pandemic.<br></p>\n<p>Earlier today I spoke to trade ministers from the G20 countries about ways to address the chronic shortage of personal protective equipment and other essential medical supplies.<br></p>\n<p>We call on countries to work with companies to increase production; to ensure the free movement of essential health products; and to ensure equitable distribution of those products, based on need.<br></p>\n<p>Specific attention should be given to low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.<br></p>\n<p>In addition, WHO is working intensively with several partners to massively increase access to life-saving products, including diagnostics, PPE, medical oxygen, ventilators and more. <br></p>\n<p>We understand that many countries are implementing measures that restrict the movement of people. <br></p>\n<p>In implementing these measures, it\u2019s vital to respect the dignity and welfare of all people. <br></p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important that governments keep their people informed about the intended duration of measures, and to provide support for older people, refugees, and other vulnerable groups.<br></p>\n<p>Governments need to ensure the welfare of people who have lost their income and are in desperate need of food, sanitation and other essential services. <br></p>\n<p>Countries should work hand-in-hand with communities to build trust and support resilience and mental health.<br></p>\n<p>===<br></p>\n<p>Two months ago, WHO published the <a href=\"/publications-detail/strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan-for-the-new-coronavirus\">Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan</a>, with an initial ask of 675 million US dollars to support countries to prepare for and respond to COVID-19.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re very grateful to the many countries and foundations who have contributed; more than 622 million dollars have been received so far, and we would like to thank the King Salman Center for Humanitarian Relief for its contribution of 10 million US dollars.<br></p>\n<p>We continue to be encouraged by the signs of global solidarity to confront and overcome this common threat. <br></p>\n<p>The commitment of G20 countries to work together to improve the production and equitable supply of essential products shows that the world is coming together.<br></p>\n<p>Yesterday I sent a tweet with a single word: humility.

Restrictive measures risk adversely impacting access to essential medical supplies for countries in Africa. We must work together to ensure we safeguard access\n    to essential medical products for low-income countries including countries in Africa.</p>\n<p>This pandemic reminds us that we have a shared destiny.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>None of us, none of our health systems, none of our economies, operate in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>We are interdependent.

We are one humanity, with one, common enemy. No country can fight alone; we can only fight together.<br></p> <p>And ignite the industrial might and innovation of the G20 to produce and distribute the tools needed to save lives.<br></p> <p>We must also make a promise to future generations, saying never again.<br></p> <p>Viral outbreaks are a fact of life.

The more countries who join the trial, the faster we will have results.<br></p> <p>In the meantime, we call on individuals and countries to refrain from using therapeutics that have not been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19. <br></p> <p>The history of medicine is strewn with examples of drugs that worked on paper, or in a test tube, but didn't work in humans or were actually harmful.<br></p> <p>During the most recent Ebola epidemic, for example, some medicines that were thought to be effective were found not to be as effective as other medicines when they were compared during a clinical trial.<br></p> <p>We must follow the evidence. There are no short-cuts.<br></p> <p>We also need to ensure that using unproven drugs does not create a shortage of those medicines to treat diseases for which they have proven effective.<br></p> <p>As the pandemic evolves and more countries are affected, we are learning more and more lessons about what works and what doesn't. <br></p> <p>WHO is continuing to support all countries in the response. <br></p> <p>We\u2019ve published more than 40 guidance documents on our website, providing detailed, evidence-based recommendations for governments, hospitals, health workers, members of the public and more.\u00a0 <br></p> <p>More than 1 million health workers have been trained through our courses on OpenWHO.org. We will continue to train more.<br></p> <p>We\u2019re also delighted to report that the COVID-19 Solidarity Fund has now received donations of more than US$ 108 million in just two weeks, from 203,000 individuals and organizations. <br></p> <p>Thank you to each and every one of you.<br></p> <p>The English version of our WhatsApp Health Alert now has more than 12 million users globally, and the Arabic, French and Spanish versions were launched today. More languages will be added, including Bangla, Chinese, Hindi, Kurdish, Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Urdu, Swahili and more. <br></p> <p>I\u2019ve said before that crises like this bring out the best and worst in humanity.<br></p> <p>We have recently seen an increase in scams, cyberattacks and impersonation using WHO, my name and COVID-19. <br></p> <p>I am very grateful to those working in various national organizations providing critical cybersecurity intelligence to the WHO Cybersecurity team. <br></p> <p>Thank you for your efforts to work with us to protect the health systems, health workers and members of the general public who rely on our information systems and digital tools.

The second 100 thousand took 11 days, the third 100 thousand took just 4 days and the fourth 100 thousand just 2 days. </p>\n<p>Without aggressive action in all countries, millions could die. </p>\n<p>The full social, economic and political fallout, only time will tell. </p>\n<p>But we know that the price we end up paying depends on the choices we make now. </p>\n<p>This is a global crisis that demands a global response. </p>\n<p>Today, I have three requests for our esteemed leaders: </p>\n<p>First, fight. Fight hard. Fight like hell. </p>\n<p>Fight like your lives depend on it \u2013 because they do. </p>\n<p>The best and only way to protect life, livelihoods and economies is to stop the virus. </p>\n<p>No excuses. No regrets. </p>\n<p>Thank you for the sacrifices your governments and people have already made. </p>\n<p>Many of your countries have imposed drastic social and economic restrictions, shutting schools and businesses, and asking people to stay at home. </p>\n<p>These measures will take some of the heat out of the epidemic, but they will not extinguish it. </p>\n<p>We must do more. </p>\n<p>We must immediately build, expand, train and deploy health workers to find, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact. </p>\n<p>This is not an option; it\u2019s an obligation. </p>\n<p>Second, unite. </p>\n<p>No country can solve this crisis alone. </p>\n<p>We\u2019re all in this together, and we will only get out of it together. </p>\n<p>That means a paradigm shift in global solidarity \u2013 in sharing experiences, expertise and resources, and in working together to keep supply lines open, and supporting nations who need our support. </p>\n<p>The global shortage of personal protective equipment is putting front-line responders in danger \u2013 and that puts all of us in danger. </p>\n<p>We call on all of your nations to increase production, remove export bans and ensure equity of distribution. </p>\n<p>Third, ignite. </p>\n<p>Repurpose the industrial might of your nations for this effort. </p>\n<p>Ignite global production for the tools we need to save lives now. </p>\n<p>Ignite innovation for vaccines and therapeutics. </p>\n<p>And ignite a global movement to ensure this never happens again. </p>\n<p>The actions we take now will have consequences for decades to come. </p>\n<p>COVID-19 is taking so much from us. But it is also giving us something: the opportunity to come together as one against a common threat, and to build a common future. </p>\n<p>We may speak different tongues and adhere to different creeds, but we are made of the same stuff. We are one human race. </p>\n<p>Fight. </p>\n<p>Unite. </p>\n<p>Ignite. </p>\n<p>And let our singular resolve be: never again. </p>\n<p>Shukran jazeelan, Your Majesty.

We will overcome this one too.<br></p> <p>The question is how large a price we will pay. <br></p> <p>Already we have lost more than 16,000 lives. We know we will lose more \u2013 how many more will be determined by the decisions we make and the actions we take now.<br></p> <p>To slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have introduced unprecedented measures, at significant social and economic cost \u2013 closing schools and businesses, cancelling sporting events and asking people to stay home and stay safe. <br></p> <p>We understand that these countries are now trying to assess when and how they will be able to ease these measures.<br></p> <p>The answer depends on what countries do while these population-wide measures are in place.<br></p> <p>Asking people to stay at home and shutting down population movement is buying time and reducing the pressure on health systems.<br></p> <p>But on their own, these measures will not extinguish epidemics.<br></p> <p>The point of these actions is to enable the more precise and targeted measures that are needed to stop transmission and save lives.<br></p> <p>We call on all countries who have introduced so-called \u201clockdown\u201d measures to use this time to attack the virus.<br></p> <p>You have created a second window of opportunity. The question is, how will you use it?<br></p> <p>There are six key actions that we recommend.<br></p> <p>First, expand, train and deploy your health care and public health workforce;<br></p> <p>Second, implement a system to find every suspected case at community level;<br></p> <p>Third, ramp up the production, capacity and availability of testing; <br></p> <p>Fourth, identify, adapt and equip facilities you will use to treat and isolate patients; <br></p> <p>Fifth, develop a clear plan and process to quarantine contacts; <br></p> <p>And sixth, refocus the whole of government on suppressing and controlling COVID-19.<br></p> <p>These measures are the best way to suppress and stop transmission, so that when restrictions are lifted, the virus doesn\u2019t resurge. <br></p> <p>The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses, only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence.<br></p> <p>Aggressive measures to find, isolate, test, treat and trace are not only the best and fastest way out of extreme social and economic restrictions \u2013 they\u2019re also the best way to prevent them.<br></p> <p>More than 150 countries and territories still have fewer than 100 cases. <br></p> <p>By taking the same aggressive actions now, these countries have the chance to prevent community transmission and avoid some of the more severe social and economic costs seen in other countries.<br></p> <p>This is especially relevant for many vulnerable countries whose health systems may collapse under the weight of the numbers of patients we've seen in some countries with community transmission.<br></p> <p>Today I joined United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Under-Secretary General for UNOCHA Mark Lowcock and UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore to launch the Global Humanitarian appeal, to support the most fragile countries who have already suffered years of acute humanitarian crises.<br></p> <p>This is much more than a health crisis, and we\u2019re committed to working as one UN to protect the world\u2019s most vulnerable people from the virus, and its consequences. <br></p> <p>We also welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s call for a global ceasefire. We are all facing a common threat, and the only way to defeat it is by coming together as one humanity, because we\u2019re one human race.<br></p> <p>We\u2019re grateful to the more than 200,000 individuals and organizations who have contributed to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. Since we launched it less than two weeks ago, the fund has raised more than US$95 million. I would like to offer my deep thanks to GSK for its generous contribution of US$10 million today.<br></p> <p>Although we are especially concerned about vulnerable countries, all countries have vulnerable populations, including older people. <br></p> <p>Older people carry the collective wisdom of our societies. They are valued and valuable members of our families and communities.<br></p> <p>But they are at higher risk of the more serious complications of COVID-19.<br></p> <p>We are listening to older people and those who work with and for them, to identify how best we can support them. <br></p> <p>We need to work together to protect older people from the virus, and to ensure their needs are being met \u2013 for food, fuel, prescription medication and human interaction.<br></p> <p>Physical distance doesn\u2019t mean social distance. <br></p> <p>We all need to check in regularly on older parents, neighbours, friends or relatives who live alone or in care homes in whatever way is possible, so they know how much they are loved and valued. <br></p> <p>All of these things are important at any time, but they are even more important during a crisis.<br></p> <p>Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for compelling and creative communications about public health. <br></p> <p>Last year, WHO announced our first Health for All Film Festival. The volume, quality and diversity of entries far surpassed our expectations. <br></p> <p>We received more than 1,300 entries from 110 countries, and today we are announcing a short list of 45 excellent short films about vital health topics. <br></p> <p>We are also announcing a distinguished panel of jurors who will judge the short list, with the winners to be announced in May. <br></p> <p>We will be showing all the short-listed films in the coming weeks on our website and social media channels.<br></p> <p>In these difficult times, film and other media are a powerful way not only of communicating important health messages, but of administering one of the most powerful medicines \u2013 hope. <br></p> <p>I thank you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---25-march-2020", "date": "25 March 2020", "title": "WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 25 March 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p>Your Excellencies, Secretary-General, colleagues, Mark and Henrietta.</p>\n<p>I am pleased to join my colleagues from across the United Nations at this critical moment in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>I want to begin by reiterating the Secretary-General\u2019s comments that now is the time for solidarity in the face of this threat to all of humanity.\u00a0 <br>\n<a> </a></p>\n<p>As you know, the pandemic has accelerated over the last two weeks and while COVID-19 is a threat to people everywhere, what's most worrying is the danger the virus poses to people already affected by crisis. </p>\n<p>People and communities that are already uprooted due to conflict, displacement, the climate crisis or other disease outbreaks are the ones we must urgently prioritize. </p>\n<p>Despite their resilience they do need our help today and this new plan lays out what has to happen right now, in order to save lives and slow the spread of this virus. </p>\n<p>I implore leaders to stand together and heed this appeal, joining the Secretary-General\u2019s call. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</p>\n<p>Since this outbreak was identified, WHO and our partners have been ramping up surveillance and lab testing across low- and middle-income countries. </p>\n<p>We\u2019ve brought scientists together to boost funding in the research and development of diagnostics, treatments and a future vaccine. </p>\n<p>We\u2019ve communicated online, via the media and in person with many world leaders, to ensure that preparations are accelerated and populations are sensitized. </p>\n<p>And we\u2019ve worked with business leaders to ensure supply chains are working and bottlenecks are overcome. </p>\n<p>The new Global Humanitarian Response Plan builds on that effort and sets a six-point action plan for how to prepare and respond to this emergency: </p>\n<p>First, the public must be effectively prepared for the critical measures that are needed to help suppress the spread and protect vulnerable groups, like the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p>\n<p>Second, ramp up surveillance and lab testing so that those with the virus can be identified quickly and isolated safely \u2013 helping to break the chains of transmission.\u00a0\u00a0 </p>\n<p>Third<strong>,</strong> prioritize treatment for those at highest risk of severe illness.\u00a0 </p>\n<p>Fourth, slow, suppress and stop transmission to reduce the burden on health care facilities. This means safe hand washing; testing, isolating cases, and contact tracing, encouraging community-level physical distancing, and the suspension of mass gatherings and international travel. </p>\n<p>For many on our planet following even this basic advice is a struggle but we as a global community must strive to make it possible. </p>\n<p>Fifth, we\u2019re building the ship as we sail and it\u2019s critical that we continue to share learnings and innovations so that we can improve surveillance, prevention, and treatment. And ensure equitable access for the poorest to all R&amp;D breakthroughs. </p>\n<p>And finally, we need to protect the health and humanitarian supply chain so that our frontline workers are protected and able to travel freely as they give lifesaving care. </p>\n<p>Our message to all countries is clear: heed this warning now, back this plan politically and financially today and we can save lives and slow the spread of this pandemic. </p>\n<p>History will judge us on how we responded to the poorest communities in their darkest hour.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s act together, right now!\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-remarks-launch-of-appeal-global-humanitarian-response-plan---25-march-2020", "date": "25 March 2020", "title": "WHO Director General's remarks Launch of Appeal: Global Humanitarian Response Plan - 25 March 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p>Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, wherever you are.<br></p>\n<p>Less than 6 months ago, WHO and FIFA signed an agreement to work together to promote health through football.<br></p>\n<p>We didn\u2019t know then what we know now \u2013 that a new virus would emerge that would bring many parts of society to a standstill \u2013 including the beautiful game.<br></p>\n<p>Many football matches have stopped \u2013 but our collaboration has become even more important during these difficult times.

That's heartbreaking.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The pandemic is accelerating. It took 67 days from the first reported case to reach the first 100,000 cases, 11 days for the second 100,000 cases and just 4 days for the third 100,000 cases. You can see how the virus is accelerating.<br></p>\n<p>But we\u2019re not prisoners to statistics. We\u2019re not helpless bystanders. We can change the trajectory of this pandemic.<br></p>\n<p>Numbers matter, because they\u2019re not just numbers. They\u2019re people, whose lives and families have been turned upside down.<br></p>\n<p>But what matters most is what we do.<br></p>\n<p>You can't win a football game only by defending. You have to attack as well.<br></p>\n<p>Asking people to stay at home and other physical distancing measures are an important way of slowing down the spread of the virus and buying time \u2013 but they are defensive measures. <br></p>\n<p>To win, we need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics \u2013 \u00a0testing every suspected case, isolating and caring for every confirmed case, and tracing and quarantining every close contact.</p>\n<p>We recognize that some countries are struggling with the capacity to carry out these offensive measures.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Several countries have shown that mobilizing resources internally from less-affected regions is one way to increase capacity.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re also grateful that several countries have sent Emergency Medical Teams to care for patients and train health workers in other countries that need support. <br></p>\n<p>This is an incredible example of international solidarity. But it\u2019s not an accident. <br></p>\n<p>WHO has been working with countries for years to build a network of Emergency Medical Teams for exactly this eventuality, to provide surge capacity of high-quality health professionals who can be deployed to care for patients and save lives. <br></p>\n<p>But health workers can only do their jobs effectively when they can do their jobs safely. <br></p>\n<p>We continue to hear alarming reports from around the world of large numbers of infections among health workers. <br></p>\n<p>Even if we do everything else right, if we don\u2019t prioritize protecting health workers, many people will die because the health worker who could have saved their life is sick.<br></p>\n<p>As you know, WHO has been working hard with many partners to rationalize and prioritize the use of personal protective equipment. <br></p>\n<p>Addressing the global shortage of these life-saving tools means addressing every part of the supply chain, from raw materials to finished product.<br></p>\n<p>Measures put in place to slow the spread of the virus may have unintended consequences by exacerbating shortages of essential protective gear, and the materials needed to make them.<br></p>\n<p>Solving this problem requires political commitment and political coordination at the global level. This week, I will be addressing heads of state and government from the G20 countries. Among other issues, I will be asking them to work together to increase production, avoid export bans and ensure equity of distribution, on the basis of need. <br></p>\n<p>We need unity in the G20 countries, who have more than 80% of global GDP. Political commitment at the G20 means strong solidarity that can help us to move forward and fight this pandemic in the strongest way possible.<br></p>\n<p>The most important ask to G20 leaders is solidarity, to act as one, because they have the biggest stake in the world, in all respects.<br></p>\n<p>We also recognize that there is a desperate need for effective therapeutics. There is currently no treatment that has been proven to be effective against COVID-19.<br></p>\n<p>It\u2019s great to see the level of energy now being directed to research against COVID-19.<br></p>\n<p>Small, observational and non-randomized studies will not give us the answers we need. Using untested medicines without the right evidence could raise false hope, and even do more harm than good and cause a shortage of essential medicines that are needed to treat other diseases. <br></p>\n<p>That\u2019s why WHO has launched the SOLIDARITY trial, to generate robust, high-quality evidence as fast as possible. I\u2019m glad that many countries have joined the SOLIDARITY trial, that will help us to move with speed and volume.<br></p>\n<p>The more countries that sign up to the SOLIDARITY trial and other large studies, the faster we will get results on which drugs work, and the more lives we will be able to save.</p>\n<p>I'd like to end by reminding everyone that although COVID-19 is dominating the world's attention, there's another respiratory disease that is both preventable and treatable, but which kills 1.5 million people every year - and that disease is the old-timer, tuberculosis.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Tomorrow is World TB Day \u2013 an opportunity to remind world leaders of the commitments they have made to end the suffering and death caused by this ancient and terrible disease. <br></p>  <p>The world is rightly responding to COVID-19 with urgency and purpose. We call on the global community to harness that same urgency and purpose for the fight against tuberculosis \u2013 and for a healthier, safer, fairer world for everyone.<br></p> <p>The rule of the game: to kick out coronavirus. <br></p> <p>I thank you.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---23-march-2020", "date": "23 March 2020", "title": "WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 23 March 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p>Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, wherever you are.<br></p>\n<p>Every day, COVID-19 seems to reach a new and tragic milestone.<br></p>\n<p>More than 210,000 cases have now been reported to WHO, and more than 9,000 people have lost their lives. <br></p>\n<p>Every loss of life is a tragedy.

But the experience of cities and countries that have pushed back this virus give hope and courage to the rest of the world.<br></p>\n<p>Every day, we are learning more about this virus and the disease it causes.<br></p>\n<p>One of the things we are learning is that although older people are the hardest hit, younger people are not spared.<br></p>\n<p>Data from many countries clearly show that people under 50 make up a significant proportion of patients requiring hospitalization. <br></p>\n<p>Today, I have a message for young people: you are not invincible. This virus could put you in hospital for weeks, or even kill you.<br></p>\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t get sick, the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else. <br></p>\n<p>I\u2019m grateful that so many young people are spreading the word and not the virus.<br></p>\n<p>As I keep saying, solidarity is the key to defeating COVID-19 - solidarity between countries, but also between age groups.<br></p>\n<p>Thank you for heeding our call for solidarity, solidarity, solidarity.<br></p>\n<p>===<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019ve said from the beginning that our greatest concern is the impact this virus could have if it gains a foothold in countries with weaker health systems, or with vulnerable populations.<br></p>\n<p>That concern has now become very real and urgent. <br></p>\n<p>We know that if this disease takes hold in these countries, there could be significant sickness and loss of life.<br></p>\n<p>But that is not inevitable. Unlike any pandemic in history, we have the power to change the way this goes.</p>\n<p>WHO is working actively to support all countries, and especially those that need our support the most.\u00a0</p>\n<p>As you know, the collapse of the market for personal protective equipment has created extreme difficulties in ensuring health workers have access to the equipment they need to do their jobs safely and effectively.<br></p>\n<p>This is an area of key concern for us. <br></p>\n<p>We have now identified some producers in China who have agreed to supply WHO.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re currently finalizing the arrangements and coordinating shipments so we can refill our warehouse to ship PPE to whoever needs it most. <br></p>\n<p>Our aim is to build a pipeline to ensure continuity of supply, with support from our partners, governments and the private sector. I am grateful to Jack Ma and his foundation as well as Aliko Dangote for their willingness to help provide essential supplies to countries in need.<br></p>\n<p>To support our call to test every suspected case, we are also working hard to increase the global supply of diagnostic tests.<br></p>\n<p>There are many companies globally that produce diagnostic kits, but WHO can only buy or recommend kits that have been evaluated independently, to ensure their quality.<br></p>\n<p>So we have worked with FIND \u2013 the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics \u2013 to contract additional labs to evaluate new diagnostics. <br></p>\n<p>In parallel, we\u2019re working with companies to secure the supply and equitable distribution of these tests. <br></p>\n<p>And we\u2019re also working with companies to increase production of the other products needed to perform the tests, from the swabs used to take samples to the large machines needed to process them.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re very grateful for the way the private sector has stepped up to lend its support to the global response.<br></p>\n<p>Just in the past few days I\u2019ve spoken with the International Chamber of Commerce, with many CEOs through the World Economic Forum, and with the \u201cB20\u201d group of business leaders from the G20 countries.<br></p>\n<p>We understand the heavy financial toll this pandemic is taking on businesses and the global economy.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re encouraged by the solidarity and generosity of business leaders to use their resources, experience and networks to improve the availability of supplies, communicate reliable information and protect their staff and customers.<br></p>\n<p>And we\u2019re also encouraged that countries around the world continue to support the global response. We thank Kuwait for its contribution of 40 million U.S. dollars.<br></p>\n<p>In addition to increasing access to masks, gloves, gowns and tests, we\u2019re also increasing access to the evidence-based technical guidance countries and health workers need to save lives.<br></p>\n<p>WHO has published guidelines for health ministers, health system administrators, and other decision-makers, to help them provide life-saving treatment as health systems are challenged, without compromising the safety of health workers.<br></p>\n<p>The guidelines detail actions all countries can take to provide care for patients, regardless of how many cases they have. They also outline specific actions to prepare health systems, according to each of the \u201c4 Cs\u201d \u2013 no cases, sporadic cases, clusters of cases, and community transmission.<br></p>\n<p>These guidelines provide a wealth of practical information on screening and triage, referral, staff, supplies, standard of care, community engagement and more.<br></p>\n<p>We encourage all countries to use these and the many other guidelines, which are all available on the WHO website.<br></p>\n<p>But we\u2019re not only advising countries. We also have advice for individuals around the world, especially those who are now adjusting to a new reality.<br></p>\n<p>We know that for many people, life is changing dramatically. <br></p>\n<p>My family is no different \u2013 my daughter is now taking her classes online from home because her school is closed.<br></p>\n<p>During this difficult time, it\u2019s important to continue looking after your physical and mental health. This will not only help you in the long-term, it will also help you fight COVID-19 if you get it.</p>\n<p>First, eat a health and nutritious diet, which helps your immune system to function properly.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Second, limit your alcohol consumption, and avoid sugary drinks. </p> <p>Third, don\u2019t smoke. Smoking can increase your risk of developing severe disease if you become infected with COVID-19.</p> <p>Fourth, exercise. WHO recommends 30 minutes of physical activity a say for adults, and one hour a day for children.\u00a0</p>\n<p>If your local or national guidelines allow it, go outside for a walk, a run or a ride, and keep a safe distance from others. If you can\u2019t leave the house, find an exercise video online, dance to music, do some yoga, or walk up and down the stairs.<br></p>   <p>If you\u2019re working at home, make sure you don\u2019t sit in the same position for long periods. Get up and take a 3-minute break every 30 minutes.<br></p> <p>We will be providing more advice on how to stay healthy at home in the coming days and weeks. <br></p> <p>Fifth, look after your mental health. It\u2019s normal to feel stressed, confused and scared during a crisis. Talking to people you know and trust can help.<br></p> <p>Supporting other people in your community can help you as much as it does them. Check in on neighbours, family and friends. Compassion is a medicine.<br></p> <p>Listen to music, read a book or play a game. <br></p> <p>And try not to read or watch too much news if it makes you anxious. Get your information from reliable sources once or twice a day.<br></p> <p>To increase access to reliable information, WHO has worked with WhatsApp and Facebook to launch a new WHO Health Alert messaging service. <br></p> <p>This service will provide the latest news and information on COVID-19, including details on symptoms and how to protect yourself.<br></p> <p>The Health Alert service is now available in English and will be introduced in other languages next week.<br></p> <p>To access it, send the word \"hi\" to the following number on WhatsApp: +41 798 931 892. We will make this information available on our website later today.<br></p> <p>COVID-19 is taking so much from us. But it\u2019s also giving us something special \u2013 the opportunity to come together as one humanity \u2013 to work together, to learn together, to grow together.<br></p> <p>I thank you.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---20-march-2020", "date": "20 March 2020", "title": "WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 20 March 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p>I will start by updating you on the numbers. We\u2019re now up to more than 200,000 cases of COVID-19, and more than 8,000 deaths. </p>\n<p>For the first time, China has reported no domestic cases \u2013 an amazing achievement. </p>\n<p>We\u2019re working to support countries in many ways, as you know. We have shipped PPE to 68 countries, and we have shipped 1.5 million diagnostic kits to 120 countries. </p>\n<p>We have a list of agreed suppliers in China now, and they have permission to export to WHO. We\u2019re now finalizing the arrangements. </p>\n<p>We\u2019ve identified producers with over-capacity, we\u2019re finalizing specifications, and coordinating shipments so we can refill our warehouse to ship PPE to whoever needs it most. </p>\n<p>Our aim is to build a continuous pipeline to ensure continuity of supply. </p>\n<p>On diagnostics, there are many companies that produce diagnostic kits, but we can only buy kits that have been evaluated independently.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong></strong>So we have worked with FIND to significantly increase capacity for evaluation by contracting additional labs to do the evaluation. </p>\n<p>In parallel, we\u2019re working with companies to secure supply. </p>\n<p>My focus on diagnostics and PPE and diagnostics is because, as you know, there is a flow of requests from many countries, and to show that we\u2019re doing our best, but the shortages will continue to be a challenge. </p>\n<p>We\u2019re also talking to the private sector and I\u2019ll come back to that later. </p>\n<p>We\u2019re monitoring progress against each of the 8 pillars of the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan. </p>\n<p>I\u2019ll start with some good news: more than 70% of countries have a COVID-19 national preparedness and response plan; 89% have lab testing capacity; \u00a0more than 70% have event-based surveillance for COVID-19; and 68% have a multi-sectoral partner coordination mechanism. </p>\n<p>Of course, this is not enough, and we expect that all countries should be ready, whether they have cases or not. </p>\n<p>But only half of countries have a national infection prevention and control programme and WASH standards in all healthcare facilities. </p>\n<p>Only half of countries that have reported to WHO have a clinical referral system in place for COVID-19. </p>\n<p>Considering what we observed lately, when health services are overwhelmed, preparing the system, I think preparing the system, especially referrals, will be very important.\u00a0</p>\n<p>On resource mobilization we have seen an encouraging response to the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan.</p>\n<p>We have now almost reached the $675 million, and we thank all those who\u2019ve contributed, and we repeat our request for flexible funding. </p>\n<p>As you know, the $675 million was for the first three months, but as you know, COVID-19 is spreading to more and more countries, so we\u2019re revising our plan and more resources and more funding will be needed, so the $675 million actually will not be enough, considering the situation. </p>\n<p>We\u2019re working on the next phase of the plan, working closely with the World Bank, IMF and others to ensure a coordinated response, and of course we\u2019re coordinating with the Global Fund too. </p>\n<p>Last Friday we launched the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, to enable individuals and organizations to contribute.\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong></strong>In just a few days we\u2019ve received contributions of $45 million from more than 173,000 individuals and organizations. </p>\n<p>I would like to use this opportunity to thank the UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation for their support in setting it up. </p>\n<p>This shows the potential for the WHO Foundation, which is in progress of establishment. We ask Member States to give their support to speed up the establishment of the WHO Foundation, but you can see its potential from what has been done with the UN Foundation. </p>\n<p>With the private sector, I addressed the Executive Board meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce last Monday. Starting with the Chairman, Mr Polman, all members have expressed their support and commitment. </p>\n<p>We also addressed a meeting organized by WEF with several CEOs yesterday, and there was strong support from that group too. </p>\n<p>We need financial support for a global security stockpile of supplies and medicines for the most vulnerable countries.</p>\n<p>From manufacturers, we need access to their production capacity, and we have tried to give them specific and concrete requests on how they can participate in the COVID response. </p>\n<p>As you know, we have already triggered the UN Crisis Management Team, and we\u2019re continuing to work across the UN system on the response. Dr Mike Ryan is the manager of the UN Crisis Management Team, and he will have more to say on this. </p>\n<p>On research and development, WHO and its partners are organizing a study in many countries in which untested treatments are compared with each other. We call this the SOLIDARITY trial. We thank those countries that have already joined and we look forward to other countries joining too. The number of countries joining this global trial is increasing, and we hope that it will involve more countries from all regions and will help us to get better results soon.</p>\n<p>As you know, the first vaccine trial has also started, just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the virus was shared, which is an unprecedented scientific triumph, and the first person was enrolled in the trial in the U.S., thanks to NIH, two days ago, and we hope this will help us as an additional solution in the right against COVID-19. </p>\n<p>We\u2019re very grateful for all the support you\u2019re providing. The funding which I have reported today would not have happened without support from Member States, and we hope you will continue your support until this pandemic is over.</p>\n<p>We have confidence in our Member States, and the only way we can defeat this pandemic, as we have always been saying, is through solidarity. Solidarity, solidarity, solidarity. </p>\n<p>That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing now. This is a common enemy. Let\u2019s keep that solidarity up. We\u2019re one human race, and that suffices actually. This is an invisible enemy against humanity. </p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-mission-briefing-on-covid-19---19-march-2020", "date": "19 March 2020", "title": "WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the Mission briefing on COVID-19 - 19 March 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p>Good afternoon.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s now more than a month since the last case of Ebola in DRC. If it stays that way, the outbreak will be declared over in less than a month\u2019s time.</p>\n<p>We\u2019d like to thank all our partners for their solidarity in staying the course in the service of the people of DRC \u2013 and my special appreciation to the government and people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>\n<p>That same spirit of solidarity must be at the centre of our efforts to defeat COVID-19.</p>\n<p>More than 200,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported to WHO, and more than 8000 people have lost their lives.</p>\n<p>More than 80% of all cases are from two regions \u2013 the Western Pacific and Europe.</p>\n<p>We know that many countries now face escalating epidemics and are feeling overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>We hear you. We know the tremendous difficulties you face and the enormous burden you\u2019re under. We understand the heart-wrenching choices you are having to make. </p>\n<p>We understand that different countries and communities are in different situations, with different levels of transmission.</p>\n<p>Every day, WHO is talking to ministers of health, heads of state, health workers, hospital managers, industry leaders, CEOs and more \u2013 to help them prepare and prioritize, according to their specific situation.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t assume your community won\u2019t be affected. Prepare as if it will be.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t assume you won\u2019t be infected. Prepare as if you will be.</p>\n<p>But there is hope. There are many things all countries can do. </p>\n<p>Physical distancing measures \u2013 like cancelling sporting events, concerts and other large gatherings \u2013 can help to slow transmission of the virus. </p>\n<p>They can reduce the burden on the health system. </p>\n<p>And they can help to make epidemics manageable, allowing targeted and focused measures.</p>\n<p>But to suppress and control epidemics, countries must isolate, test, treat and trace.</p>\n<p>If they don\u2019t, transmission chains can continue at a low level, then resurge once physical distancing measures are lifted.</p>\n<p>WHO continues to recommend that isolating, testing and treating every suspected case, and tracing every contact, must be the backbone of the response in every country. This is the best hope of preventing widespread community transmission.</p>\n<p>Most countries with sporadic cases or clusters of cases are still in the position to do this.</p>\n<p>Many countries are listening to our call and finding solutions to increase their ability to implement the full package of measures that have turned the tide in several countries.</p>\n<p>But we know that some countries are experiencing intense epidemics with extensive community transmission.</p>\n<p>We understand the effort required to suppress transmission in these situations. But it can be done. </p>\n<p>A month ago, the Republic of Korea was faced with accelerating community transmission. But it didn\u2019t surrender.</p>\n<p>It educated, empowered and engaged communities; </p>\n<p>It developed an innovative testing strategy and expanded lab capacity; </p>\n<p>It rationed the use of masks;</p>\n<p>It did exhaustive contact tracing and testing in selected areas; </p>\n<p>And it isolated suspected cases in designated facilities rather than hospitals or at home.</p>\n<p>As a result, cases have been declining for weeks. At the peak there were more than 800 cases, and today the report was only 90 cases.</p>\n<p>WHO is working in solidarity with other countries with community transmission to apply the lessons learned in Korea and elsewhere, and adapt them to the local context.</p>\n<p>Likewise, WHO continues to recommend that, wherever possible, confirmed mild cases should be isolated in health facilities, where trained professionals can provide good medical care, and prevent clinical progression and onward transmission.</p>\n<p>If that\u2019s not possible, countries can use community facilities to isolate and care for mild cases and refer them for specialized care quickly if needed.</p>\n<p>If health facilities are at risk of being overwhelmed, people with mild disease can be cared for at home. </p>\n<p>Although this is not the ideal situation, WHO has advice on our website for how home-care can be provided as safely as possible.</p>\n<p>WHO continues to call on all countries to implement a comprehensive approach, with the aim of slowing down transmission and flattening the curve. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This approach is saving lives and buying time for the development of vaccines and treatments.</p>\n<p>As you know, the first vaccine trial has begun, just 60 days after the genetic sequence of the virus was shared by China. This is an incredible achievement. </p>\n<p>We commend the researchers around the world who have come together to systemically evaluate experimental therapeutics.</p> <p>Multiple small trials with different methodologies may not give us the clear, strong evidence we need about which treatments help to save lives.</p> <p>WHO and its partners are therefore organizing a study in many countries in which some of these untested treatments are compared with each other. </p> <p>This large, international study is designed to generate the robust data we need, to show which treatments are the most effective. </p> <p>We have called this study the SOLIDARITY trial.</p> <p>The SOLIDARITY trial provides simplified procedures to enable even hospitals that have been overloaded to participate. </p> <p>Many countries have already confirmed that they will join the SOLIDARITY trial - Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, Iran, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand - and I trust many more will join.</p> <p>I continue to be inspired by the many demonstrations of solidarity from all over the world.</p> <p>The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund has now raised more than US$43 million from more than 173,000 individuals and organizations, a few days since we launched it. I\u2019d especially like to thank FIFA for its contribution of US$10 million.</p> <p>These and other efforts give me hope that together, we can and will prevail.</p> <p>This virus is presenting us with an unprecedented threat. But it\u2019s also an unprecedented opportunity to come together as one against a common enemy \u2013 an enemy against humanity. </p> <p>I thank you.</p>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---18-march-2020", "date": "18 March 2020", "title": "WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 18 March 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p>Good afternoon everyone.<br></p>\n<p>In the past week, we have seen a rapid escalation of cases of COVID-19. <br></p>\n<p>More cases and deaths have now been reported in the rest of the world than in China. <br></p>\n<p>We have also seen a rapid escalation in social distancing measures, like closing schools and cancelling sporting events and other gatherings.<br></p>\n<p>But we have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing \u2013 which is the backbone of the response.<br></p>\n<p>Social distancing measures can help to reduce transmission and enable health systems to cope. <br></p>\n<p>Handwashing and coughing into your elbow can reduce the risk for yourself and others. <br></p>\n<p>But on their own, they are not enough to extinguish this pandemic. It\u2019s the combination that makes the difference.<br></p>\n<p>As I keep saying, all countries must take a comprehensive approach.<br></p>\n<p>But the most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate. <br></p>\n<p>You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don\u2019t know who is infected. <br></p>\n<p>We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.<br></p>\n<p>Test every suspected case. <br></p>\n<p>If they test positive, isolate them and find out who they have been in close contact with up to 2 days before they developed symptoms, and test those people too. [NOTE: WHO recommends testing contacts of confirmed cases only if they show symptoms of COVID-19]<br></p>\n<p>Every day, more tests are being produced to meet the global demand. <br></p>\n<p>WHO has shipped almost 1.5 million tests to 120 countries. We\u2019re working with companies to increase the availability of tests for those most in need.<br></p>\n<p>WHO advises that all confirmed cases, even mild cases, should be isolated in health facilities, to prevent transmission and provide adequate care.<br></p>\n<p>But we recognize that many countries have already exceeded their capacity to care for mild cases in dedicated health facilities.<br></p>\n<p>In that situation, countries should prioritize older patients and those with underlying conditions.<br></p>\n<p>Some countries have expanded their capacity by using stadiums and gyms to care for mild cases, with severe and critical cases cared for in hospitals. <br></p>\n<p>Another option is for patients with mild disease to be isolated and cared for at home. <br></p>\n<p>Caring for infected people at home may put others in the same household at risk, so it\u2019s critical that care-givers follow WHO\u2019s guidance on how to provide care as safely as possible.<br></p>\n<p>For example, both the patient and their care-giver should wear a medical mask when they are together in the same room.<br></p>\n<p>The patient should sleep in a separate bedroom to others and use a different bathroom. <br></p>\n<p>Assign one person to care for the patient, ideally someone who is in good health and has no underlying conditions.<br></p>\n<p>The care-giver should wash their hands after any contact with the patient or their immediate environment.<br></p>\n<p>People infected with COVID-19 can still infect others after they stop feeling sick, so these measures should continue for at least two weeks after symptoms disappear.<br></p>\n<p>Visitors should not be allowed until the end of this period.<br></p>\n<p>There are more details in WHO\u2019s guidance.<br></p>\n<p>===<br></p>\n<p>Once again, our key message is: test, test, test.<br></p>\n<p>This is a serious disease. Although the evidence we have suggests that those over 60 are at highest risk, young people, including children, have died. <br></p>\n<p>WHO has issued new clinical guidance, with specific details on how to care for children, older people and pregnant women.<br></p>\n<p>So far, we have seen epidemics in countries with advanced health systems. But even they have struggled to cope. <br></p>\n<p>As the virus moves to low-income countries, we're deeply concerned about the impact it could have among populations with high HIV prevalence, or among malnourished children.<br></p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on every country and every individual to do everything they can to stop transmission.<br></p>\n<p>Washing your hands will help to reduce your risk of infection. But it\u2019s also an act of solidarity because it reduces the risk you will infect others in your community and around the world. Do it for yourself, do it for others.<br></p>\n<p>We also ask people to express their solidarity by refraining from hoarding essential items, including medicines.<br></p>\n<p>Hoarding can create shortages of medicines and other essential products, which can exacerbate suffering.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re grateful to everyone who has contributed to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. <br></p>\n<p>Since we launched it on Friday, more than 110,000 people have contributed almost 19 million U.S. dollars. <br></p>\n<p>These funds will help to buy diagnostic tests, supplies for health workers and support research and development.<br></p>\n<p>If you would like to contribute, please go to who.int and click on the orange \u201cDonate\u201d button at the top of the page.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re also grateful for the way different sectors of society are coming together. <br></p>\n<p>This started with the SafeHands Challenge, which has attracted celebrities, world leaders and people everywhere demonstrating how to wash their hands.<br></p>\n<p>This afternoon WHO and the International Chamber of Commerce issued a joint call to action to the global business community. The ICC will send regular advice to its network of more than 45 million businesses, to protect their workers, customers and local communities, and to support the production and distribution of essential supplies.<br></p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to thank Paul Polman, Ajay Banga and John Denton for their support and collaboration.<br></p>\n<p>WHO is also working with Global Citizen to launch the Solidarity Sessions, a series of virtual concerts with leading musicians from around the world. <br></p>\n<p>===<br></p>\n<p>This is the defining global health crisis of our time. <br></p>\n<p>The days, weeks and months ahead will be a test of our resolve, a test of our trust in science, and a test of solidarity.<br></p>\n<p>Crises like this tend to bring out the best and worst in humanity. <br></p>\n<p>Like me, I\u2019m sure you have been touched by the videos of people applauding health workers from their balconies, or the stories of people offering to do grocery shopping for older people in their community.<br></p>\n<p>This amazing spirit of human solidarity must become even more infectious than the virus itself. Although we may have to be physically apart from each other for a while, we can come together in ways we never have before.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re all in this together.

We know you are stretched to the limit.<br></p>\n<p>You have our admiration, our respect, and our commitment to doing everything we can to keep you safe and enable you to do your job.</p>\n<p>More than 132,000 cases of COVID-19 have now been reported to WHO, from 123 countries and territories.</p>\n<p>5,000 people have lost their lives, a tragic milestone.</p>\n<p>Europe has now become the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China.<br></p>\n<p>More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re encouraged that many countries are now acting on the 8 pillars of WHO\u2019s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan. <br></p>\n<p>Most countries now have a national plan; most are taking a multi-sectoral approach and most have laboratory testing capacity.<br></p>\n<p>WHO has evidence-based guidance that every country can use, according to each of the 8 pillars.<br></p>\n<p>And we\u2019re continuing to support countries to prepare and respond.<br></p>\n<p>We have shipped supplies of personal protective equipment to 56 countries, we\u2019re shipping to a further 28 countries, and we\u2019ve sent almost 1.5 million diagnostic tests to 120 countries.<br></p>\n<p>Our message to countries continues to be: you must take a comprehensive approach. <br></p>\n<p>Not testing alone. Not contact tracing alone. Not quarantine alone. Not social distancing alone. Do it all.<br></p>\n<p>Any country that looks at the experience of other countries with large epidemics and thinks \u201cthat won\u2019t happen to us\u201d is making a deadly mistake. It can happen to any country. <br></p>\n<p>The experience of China, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and others clearly demonstrates that aggressive testing and contact tracing, combined with social distancing measures and community mobilization, can prevent infections and save lives.<br></p>\n<p>Japan is also demonstrating that a whole-of-government approach led by Prime Minister Abe himself, supported by in-depth investigation of clusters, is a critical step in reducing transmission. <br></p>\n<p>WHO has clear advice for governments, businesses and individuals.<br></p>\n<p>First, prepare and be ready. <br></p>\n<p>Every person must know the signs and symptoms and how to protect themselves and others.<br></p>\n<p>Every health worker should be able to recognize this disease, provide care and know what to do with their patients. <br></p>\n<p>Every health facility should be ready to cope with large numbers of patients, and ensure the safety of staff and patients.<br></p>\n<p>Second, detect, protect and treat.<br></p>\n<p>You can\u2019t fight a virus if you don\u2019t know where it is. Find, isolate, test and treat every case, to break the chains of transmission.<br></p>\n<p>Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.<br></p>\n<p>Third, reduce transmission.<br></p>\n<p>Do not just let this fire burn.<br></p>\n<p>Isolate the sick and quarantine their contacts. In addition, measures that increase social distancing such as cancelling sporting events may help to reduce transmission. These measures, of course, should be based on local context and risk assessment, and should be time-limited.<br></p>\n<p>Even if you cannot stop transmission, you can slow it down and save lives.<br></p>\n<p>And fourth, innovate and learn.<br></p>\n<p>This is a new virus and a new situation. We\u2019re all learning, and we must all find new ways to prevent infections, save lives, and minimize impact. All countries have lessons to share. <br></p>\n<p>There are simple, effective things we can all do to reduce the risk of infection for ourselves and those around us.</p>\n<p>Clean your hands regularly with an alcohol-based rub or soap and water.<br></p>\n<p>Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow if you cough or sneeze. </p>\n<p>Stay home if you\u2019re sick.<br></p>\n<p>Avoid unnecessary travel and large social gatherings.<br></p>\n<p>Comply with the advice of your local or national health authority.<br></p>\n<p>Find and share reliable information.<br></p>\n<p>And finally, you can give.<br></p>\n<p>Together with the United Nations Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, WHO is today launching the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, to enable individuals and organizations to contribute.<br></p>\n<p>Until now, we have been relying mainly on governments to support the response.<br></p>\n<p>We thank all those countries who have supported WHO\u2019s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan, including Japan, which this week contributed US$46\u00a0 million to WHO. [NOTE: This text has been corrected to $46 million. On 10 March, Japan announced an overall contribution to the global COVID-19 response of 15.5 billion yen.]</p>\n<p>Now everyone can contribute. <br></p>\n<p>Funds raised will be used to coordinate the response, to buy masks, gloves, gowns and goggles for health workers, to buy diagnostic tests, to improve surveillance, and to invest in research and development.<br></p>\n<p>To give to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, go to who.int, and look for the orange \u201cDonate\u201d button at the top of the page.<br></p>\n<p>We thank Google, Facebook and the individuals who have already contributed. <br></p>\n<p>Every dollar donated is a dollar towards saving lives.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re all in this together.<br></p>\n<p>I thank you.</p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-mission-briefing-on-covid-19---13-march-2020", "date": "13 March 2020", "title": "WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 13 March 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p>Excellencies, dear colleagues and friends,</p>\n<p>First of all, I would like to say good morning. </p>\n<p>As you know, yesterday I said that that the global COVID-19 outbreak can now be described as a pandemic. </p>\n<p>This is not a decision we took lightly. </p>\n<p>We have made this assessment for two main reasons: first, because of the speed and scale of transmission. </p>\n<p>Almost 125,000 cases have now been reported to WHO, from 118 countries and territories. In the past two weeks, the number of cases reported outside China has increased almost 13-fold, and the number of affected countries has almost tripled. </p>\n<p>The second reason is that despite our frequent warnings, we are deeply concerned that some countries are not approaching this threat with the level of political commitment needed to control it. </p>\n<p>Let me be clear: describing this as a pandemic does not mean that countries should give up. The idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, we have to double down. </p>\n<p>This is a controllable pandemic. Countries that decide to give up on fundamental public health measures may end up with a larger problem, and a heavier burden on the health system that requires more severe measures to control.</p>\n<p>All countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights.</p>\n<p>We urge all countries to take a comprehensive approach tailored to their circumstances \u2013 with containment as the central pillar. </p>\n<p>We are calling on countries to take a four-pronged strategy:</p>\n<p>First, prepare and be ready. </p>\n<p>There are still 77 countries and territories with no reported cases, and 55 countries and territories that have reported 10 cases or less.</p>\n<p>And all countries with cases have unaffected areas. You have an opportunity to keep it that way. Prepare your people and your health facilities.</p>\n<p>Second, detect, prevent and treat.</p>\n<p>You can\u2019t fight a virus if you don\u2019t know where it is. That means robust surveillance to find, isolate, test and treat every case, to break the chains of transmission.</p>\n<p>Third, reduce and suppress.</p>\n<p>To save lives we must reduce transmission. That means finding and isolating as many cases as possible, and quarantining their closest contacts. Even if you cannot stop transmission, you can slow it down and protect health facilities, old age homes and other vital areas \u2013 but only if you test all suspected cases. </p>\n<p>And fourth, innovate and improve. </p>\n<p>This is a new virus and a new situation. We\u2019re all learning and we must all find new ways to prevent infections, save lives, and minimize impact. All countries have lessons to share.\u00a0</p>\n<p>WHO is working day and night to support all countries. </p>\n<p>We have shipped supplies of personal protective equipment to 57 countries, we\u2019re preparing to ship to a further 28, and we\u2019ve shipped lab supplies to 120 countries.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve published an R&amp;D roadmap, with a set of core protocols for how studies should be done. </p>\n<p>We\u2019ve published a comprehensive package of technical guidance. </p>\n<p>We\u2019ve had more than 176,000 enrollments in our COVID training courses on OpenWHO.\u00a0</p>\n<p>We\u2019re working with the World Economic Forum and the International Chambers of Commerce to engage the private sector. We\u2019re also working with FIFA. </p>\n<p>We\u2019re working with our colleagues across the UN system to support countries to develop their preparedness and response plans, according to the 8 pillars. </p>\n<p>And more than 440 million U.S. dollars has now been pledged to WHO\u2019s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan</p>\n<p>We thank those countries that have contributed, especially those that have contributed fully flexible funds. Because this is a dynamic situation, we need the greatest flexibility possible to provide the best support possible. In the spirit of solidarity, we ask countries not to earmark funds for this response. </p>\n<p>Thank you all once again for your support and commitment. </p>\n<p>As I keep saying, we\u2019re all in this together. </p>\n<p>I thank you.</p>                                                                 </div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-mission-briefing-on-covid-19---12-march-2020", "date": "12 March 2020", "title": "WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the Mission briefing on COVID-19 - 12 March 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good afternoon.<br></p> <p>In the past two weeks, the number of cases of COVID-19 outside China has increased 13-fold, and the number of affected countries has tripled. \u00a0</p> <p>There are now more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries, and 4,291 people have lost their lives.\u00a0</p> <p>Thousands more are fighting for their lives in hospitals.<br></p> <p>In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected countries climb even higher.<br></p> <p>WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.<br></p> <p>We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.\u00a0</p> <p>Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.<br></p> <p>Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO\u2019s assessment of the threat posed by this virus. It doesn\u2019t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn\u2019t change what countries should do.<br></p> <p>We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. This is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus.<br></p> <p>And we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled, at the same time. \u00a0</p> <p>WHO has been in full response mode since we were notified of the first cases. \u00a0</p> <p>And we have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action.<br></p> <p>We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear.\u00a0</p> <p>===<br></p> <p>As I said on Monday, just looking at the number of cases and the number of countries affected does not tell the full story.<br></p> <p>Of the 118,000 cases reported globally in 114 countries, more than 90 percent of cases are in just four countries, and two of those \u2013 China and the Republic of Korea - have significantly declining epidemics.\u00a0</p> <p>81 countries have not reported any cases, and 57 countries have reported 10 cases or less.<br></p> <p>We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. <br></p> <p>If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace, and mobilize their people in the response, those with a handful of cases can prevent those cases becoming clusters, and those clusters becoming community transmission.<br></p> <p>Even those countries with community transmission or large clusters can turn the tide on this virus.\u00a0</p> <p>Several countries have demonstrated that this virus can be suppressed and controlled.\u00a0</p> <p>The challenge for many countries who are now dealing with large clusters or community transmission is not whether they <strong>can</strong> do the same \u2013 it\u2019s whether they <strong>will</strong>. \u00a0</p> <p>Some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity.\u00a0</p> <p>Some countries are struggling with a lack of resources.\u00a0</p> <p>Some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve.<br></p> <p>We are grateful for the measures being taken in Iran, Italy and the Republic of Korea to slow the virus and control their epidemics. <br></p> <p>We know that these measures are taking a heavy toll on societies and economies, just as they did in China.<br></p> <p>All countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimizing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights.<br></p> <p>WHO\u2019s mandate is public health.

It\u2019s now three weeks since the last case was reported, and a week since the last survivor left the treatment centre. We are now in the countdown to the end of the outbreak.</p>\n<p>We continue to investigate alerts and vaccinate contacts every day, and the security situation in North Kivu remains fragile. </p>\n<p>In previous Ebola outbreaks we have seen flare-ups even after the end of the outbreak, so we are continuing to provide follow-up care for more than 1100 survivors, and keeping teams on the ground to respond quickly to flare-ups if needed.</p>\n<p>The outbreak may be ending \u2013 but our determination is not. </p>\n<p>And nor is our commitment to combating the COVID-19 epidemic.</p>\n<p>As you know, over the weekend we crossed 100,000 reported cases of COVID-19 in 100 countries.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s certainly troubling that so many people and countries have been affected, so quickly.</p>\n<p>Now that the virus has a foothold in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic has become very real.</p>\n<p>But it would be the first pandemic in history that could be controlled.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is: we are not at the mercy of this virus.</p>\n<p>The great advantage we have is that the decisions we all make \u2013 as governments, businesses, communities, families and individuals \u2013 can influence the trajectory of this epidemic.</p>\n<p>We need to remember that with decisive, early action, we can slow down the virus and prevent infections. Among those who are infected, most will recover.</p>\n<p>Of the 80,000 reported cases in China, more than 70% have recovered and been discharged. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to remember that looking only at the total number of reported cases and the total number of countries doesn\u2019t tell the full story. </p>\n<p>Of all the cases reported globally so far, 93% are from just four countries. </p>\n<p>This is an uneven epidemic at the global level.<br></p>\n<p>Different countries are in different scenarios, requiring a tailored response.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not about containment <strong>or</strong> mitigation \u2013 which is a false dichotomy. It\u2019s about both. </p>\n<p>All countries must take a comprehensive blended strategy for controlling their epidemics and pushing this deadly virus back.</p>\n<p>Countries that continue finding and testing cases and tracing their contacts not only protect their own people, they can also affect what happens in other countries and globally.</p>\n<p>WHO has consolidated our guidance for countries in 4 categories: those with no cases; those with sporadic cases; those with clusters; and those with community transmission.</p>\n<p>For all countries, the aim is the same: stop transmission and prevent the spread of the virus. </p>\n<p>For the first three categories, countries must focus on finding, testing, treating and isolating individual cases, and following their contacts.</p>\n<p>In areas with community spread, testing every suspected case and tracing their contacts becomes more challenging. Action must be taken to prevent transmission at the community level to reduce the epidemic to manageable clusters. </p>\n<p>Depending on their context, countries with community transmission could consider closing schools, cancelling mass gatherings and other measures to reduce exposure.</p>\n<p>The fundamental elements of the response are the same for all countries:</p>\n<p>Emergency response mechanisms;</p>\n<p>Risk communications and public engagement;</p>\n<p>Case finding and contact tracing; </p>\n<p>Public health measures such as hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and social distancing;</p>\n<p>Laboratory testing;</p>\n<p>Treating patients and hospital readiness;</p>\n<p>Infection prevention and control;</p>\n<p>And an all-of-society, all-of-government approach.</p>\n<p>There are many examples of countries demonstrating that these measures work.</p>\n<p>China, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United States of America and many others have activated emergency measures.</p>\n<p>Singapore is a good example of an all-of-government approach \u2013 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s regular videos are helping to explain the risks and reassure people.</p>\n<p>The Republic of Korea has increased efforts to identify all cases and contacts, including drive-through temperature testing to widen the net and catch cases that might otherwise be missed.</p>\n<p>Nigeria, Senegal and Ethiopia have strengthened surveillance and diagnostic capacity to find cases quickly.</p>\n<p>Further details on specific actions countries should take in specific contexts are available on WHO\u2019s website.</p>\n<p>WHO is continuing to support countries in all four scenarios. </p>\n<p>We have shipped supplies of personal protective equipment to 57 countries, we\u2019re preparing to ship to a further 28, and we\u2019ve shipped lab supplies to 120 countries.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re also working with our colleagues across the UN system to support countries to develop their preparedness and response plans, according to the 8 pillars.</p>\n<p>And we have set up a partners platform to match country needs with contributions from donors. </p>\n<p>As you know, more funds are being made available for the response, and we\u2019re very grateful to all countries and partners who have contributed. Just since Friday, Azerbaijan, China, the Republic of Korea, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have announced contributions.</p>\n<p>Almost 300 million U.S. dollars has now been pledged to WHO\u2019s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan. </p>\n<p>We are encouraged by these signs of global solidarity. And we continue to call on all countries to take early and aggressive action to protect their people and save lives.</p>\n<p>For the moment, only a handful of countries have signs of sustained community transmission.</p>\n<p>Most countries still have sporadic cases or defined clusters. We must all take heart from that.</p>\n<p>As long as that\u2019s the case, those countries have the opportunity to break the chains of transmission, prevent community transmission and reduce the burden on their health systems.</p>\n<p>Of the four countries with the most cases, China is bringing its epidemic under control and there is now a decline in new cases being reported from the Republic of Korea.</p>\n<p>Both these countries demonstrate that it\u2019s never too late to turn back the tide on this virus. </p>\n<p>The rule of the game is: never give up.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re encouraged that Italy is taking aggressive measures to contain its epidemic, and we hope that those measures prove effective in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Let hope be the antidote to fear. </p>\n<p>Let solidarity be the antidote to blame.</p>\n<p>Let our shared humanity be the antidote to our shared threat.</p>\n<p>I thank you.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n", "url":

remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 - 9 March 2020"}, {"content": "\n        <div>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good afternoon, and thank you once again for joining us in person and online.<br></p>\n<p>I would like to start by acknowledging International Women\u2019s Day this Sunday. <br></p>\n<p>This is a moment to remember that around the world, many women cannot access essential health services, and continue to suffer disproportionately from preventable and treatable diseases.<br></p>\n<p>But International Women\u2019s Day is an opportunity not only to promote and protect the health of women, but to highlight the vital role they play in promoting and protecting the health of all people.<br></p>\n<p>Globally, women make up 70% of the global health workforce, but hold only 25% of senior roles.<br></p>\n<p>WHO is committed to promoting gender equality everywhere, and especially in the health workforce.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re proud that we have achieved gender equality in our senior leadership team at WHO headquarters, although we know we still have work to do in other parts of the Organization.<br></p>\n<p>Women are also playing a vital role in the response to COVID-19, and we\u2019re proud to have many amazing women leading our response in WHO, including Maria, Sylvie, Soumya, Ana Maria, Mari\u00e2ngela, Marie Pierre, Adriana, Gabby, Nyka and many others.<br></p>\n<p>In the past 24 hours, 2736 cases of COVID-19 were reported from 47 countries and territories.<br></p>\n<p>There is now a total of 98,023 reported cases of COVID-19 globally, and 3380 deaths.<br></p>\n<p>We are now on the verge of reaching 100,000 confirmed cases.<br></p>\n<p>As cases increase, we are continuing to recommend that all countries make containment their highest priority.<br></p>\n<p>We continue to call on countries to find, test, isolate and care for every case, and to trace every contact. <br></p>\n<p>Slowing down the epidemic saves lives, and it buys time for preparedness and for research and development. <br></p>\n<p>Every day we can slow down the epidemic is another day hospitals can prepare themselves for cases. <br></p>\n<p>Every day we slow down the epidemic is another day governments can prepare their health workers to detect, test, treat and care for patients. <br></p>\n<p>Every day we slow down the epidemic is another day closer to having vaccines and therapeutics, which can in turn prevent infections and save lives. <br></p>\n<p>As you know, last month WHO convened a meeting of more than 400 scientists to identify research priorities.<br></p>\n<p>Hundreds of ideas were discussed and debated, and today we are publishing an R&amp;D roadmap which distills those ideas into a core group of priorities in 9 key areas.<br></p>\n<p>These include the natural history of the virus, epidemiology, vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics, clinical management, ethical considerations, social sciences and more.<br></p>\n<p>The R&amp;D roadmap focuses on research that can save lives now, as well as longer-term research priorities for vaccines and therapeutics. <br></p>\n<p>It\u2019s vital to coordinate research so that different groups around the world complement each other, so WHO can give better advice, and countries can take evidence-based decisions that save lives.<br></p>\n<p>That\u2019s why WHO has developed a set of core protocols that outline standards for how studies should be done, and to collect critical data so we can compare apples with apples and pool data from multiple studies.<br></p>\n<p>France and South Africa have already indicated they will use these protocols for clinical trials, and we encourage other countries to do the same. <br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re also developing research protocols to assess interventions for disenfranchised communities such as refugees and internally displaced persons.<br></p>\n<p>We\u2019re very encouraged by the level of interest around the world in accelerating research as part of the response. <br></p>\n<p>So far WHO has received applications for review and approval of 40 diagnostic tests, 20 vaccines are in development and many clinical trials of therapeutics are underway.<br></p>\n<p>Even as we test therapeutics, we need to ensure that supplies of those medicines are available should they prove effective.<br></p>\n<p>WHO has been monitoring the potential risk of a disruption to medicines supplies as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic. <br></p>\n<p>China, as you know, is a major producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and the intermediate products that are used to produce medicines in other countries. <br></p>\n<p>WHO has focused on the most essential medicines that are critical for primary health care and emergencies, including antibiotics, pain killers, and treatments for diabetes, hypertension, HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria.<br></p>\n<p>WHO is working closely with industry associations, regulators and other partners to monitor this risk, and so far we have not identified any imminent specific shortages. <br></p>\n<p>Many manufacturers either have alternative sources of ingredients, or had stocks to draw on.
