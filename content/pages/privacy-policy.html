    user and keep track of your clicks through our website. Cookies are
    commonly used to "maintain the state" of a browser session. For
    example, users can place items in a shopping cart, switch to another
    page or even another site, and when they come back, the site
    recognizes them via a fraction of their IP address and indicate e.g.
    the current state of the cart.</p>
