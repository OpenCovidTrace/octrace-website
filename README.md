## Fully Private Open Source Contact Tracing
The promise of privacy is not enough. Thatâ€™s why verification of privacy being preserved through open source is a must.


OpenCovidTrace is an open-source platform integrating all popular BLE  (Bluetooth Low Energy) contact tracing protocols ( [DP-3T](https://github.com/DP-3T), [Google & Apple](https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing), [BlueTrace](https://github.com/opentrace-community), etc.) with an additional set of features for iOS and Android platforms.


Our vision is to provide a trustworthy contact tracing tool with universal interoperability, that empowers people and communities to fight Coronavirus.


Our mission is to develop an open-source implementation for proprietary protocols (such as Apple & Google and BlueTrace backends) which addresses privacy concerns in terms of preservation of individual privacy, and integrates with all popular open-source protocols (such as DP-3T).
